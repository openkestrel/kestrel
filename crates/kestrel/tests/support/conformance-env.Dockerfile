# The second agent the conformance suite runs against is reached through an older adapter
# release, built into a copy of the shipped image that already carries the current one.

# No default: the tests always pass the `kestrel-env` the run is consuming, and a build by hand
# must name one rather than quietly derive from an operator's.
# Declared before the first stage, because only then does it reach a `FROM`.
