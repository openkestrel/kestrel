//! The shipped compose stack as a test drives it: built and brought up the way the README

//! its volume. Every resource the suite touches is scoped to a namespace derived from this
//! checkout, so two checkouts on one daemon never address the same project, volume, network,
//! image or host port.
//!
//! Each carries a label naming this checkout too (`CHECKOUT_LABELS`), so a checkout deleted
//! without bringing its stack down can be swept by the next suite that runs.
