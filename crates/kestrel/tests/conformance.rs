//! The suite kestrel's v1 gate is judged at (ADR-0007): kestrel's ACP client against two agents
//! of different lineages, one that speaks the protocol natively and one reached through an
//! adapter, both driving a real model.
//!
//! Every assertion here is asked of ACP rather than of a binary. What each agent is called, how
//! it is logged in and how it is configured live in `support::lineage`, which is the setup; a
//! failure in this file names the promise ACP makes that kestrel relied on and did not get.
//!
//! Both agents here advertise a model a client may select, so the harness that advertises none
//! is the scripted ACP agent's to play, in `tests/acp.rs`; what this suite has instead is each
//! harness naming the same model differently, and refusing the other's name for it.
//!
//! It costs network and model spend, so it is gated to nightly and to a release rather than run
//! per commit, and every test is ignored by default. What each Session spent is written to
//! `target/conformance-spend.md` for the job that ran it to publish.
