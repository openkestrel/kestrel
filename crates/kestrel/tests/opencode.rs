//! The default Harness, driven over ACP (ADR-0007): the assertions the scripted ACP
//! agent already carries, made against the real binary the `kestrel-env` image ships.
//!
//! opencode is named where the spawn command is built and where its own configuration file is
//! written, and nowhere else: everything asserted here is asked of ACP.
//!
//! Every test here builds and runs the image, which a `cargo test` has no business doing on
//! its own, so they are ignored by default and CI runs them with `--ignored`.
