# kestrel

kestrel runs coding agents on your own infrastructure, triggered by the events your team already
produces: Slack threads, Linear tickets, GitHub issues and PRs, webhooks, schedules. Workspaces live in
isolated environments, survive restarts, and anyone on the team can join one mid-flight.

The point is to move engineers from *in* the loop to *on* the loop. Agent work that only happens when
someone is sitting in front of a terminal stays a novelty, because the human is still the scheduler
and the bottleneck. kestrel takes the events a team already produces, runs the work on infrastructure
you control, reports back to the surface that started it, and lets a person pick the thread up at any
point without losing what came before.

## Status

Early, and honest about it: rung `0.1` is under construction. Workspaces are durable — declare an
organization, a project and an agent, open a workspace against them, and its state and transcript
are still there after the process is killed. Sessions execute: enqueue one and the control plane
provisions an isolated container, clones the project's repositories into it, and drives opencode
there by speaking the Agent Client Protocol over the link in
[`openapi/link.json`](openapi/link.json), which the environment dials out to, authenticating as the
session it is executing, and reconnects to with its cursor when the control plane restarts under it.
Beside the link, on a listener of its own, the control plane serves the operator boundary in
[`openapi/operator.json`](openapi/operator.json), and it is the only way in: `kestrel`, the Client
an operator installs, declares and lists organizations, projects and agents over it, sets and
forgets provider credentials and the subscription profiles a workspace names, registers integrations
and reads the events they record, and
`kestrel workspace transcript --follow` streams a workspace's transcript over it, all from outside the
control plane's process. What stops a session short of useful work is that
nothing carries a task to it: every session asks its agent the same fixed question, and nothing triggers
or schedules one, so every workspace is opened by hand.
[`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md) walks all of that on your own machine and says where it stops. The repo also
holds the vocabulary, in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md), and the full planning trail in the issue
tracker, where every decision below is written down with its reasoning and the objections it
survived. This document is the direction, written first so the implementation has something to be
judged against; [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) is the order it gets built in, and it carries the marker
for where the project actually is.

## Running it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/openkestrel/kestrel
cd kestrel
docker compose up
```

One command, no kestrel configuration file, and no values for an operator to supply — kestrel
asks for none of its own, and vendor credentials are the only thing it ever will. Three images
come up: the control plane, the image a session executes in, and the filtered socket proxy the Docker
daemon is reached through. The database is on a named volume, so bringing the stack down and up
again keeps every workspace and its transcript.

The stack publishes the operator boundary on the host's loopback, at `127.0.0.1:7718`, and kestrel's
surface is the Client that reaches it, installed on its own:

```sh
cargo install --locked --path crates/kestrel-client
kestrel status
```

[`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md) walks from here to a session that has reached and left an environment.

**A provider key is the one value kestrel asks for, and it is the operator's.** It is held by the
organization, encrypted with a key kestrel generates at first boot beside its database, and reaches
an environment only as the agent it belongs to is spawned:
[ADR-0010](docs/adr/0010-a-provider-credential-crosses-the-link-at-the-spawn.md) says where it does
and does not go.

**The control plane never holds the Docker socket.** It reaches the daemon through a proxy that
forwards the ten requests the compute driver makes and refuses everything else, which is the
shipped default rather than a hardening step:
[ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-the-daemon-is-reached-through-a-filtered-proxy.md) lists what is allowed
and says plainly what the filter does not buy.

## What kestrel is

kestrel ships as a self-hostable platform, installed and operated as one system: you point it at
your repositories and your event sources and it runs agents for you. The framework and SDK seams get
extracted later, once they have proven themselves inside something people actually run. Five ideas
carry the whole product, and they are defined precisely in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md):

- **Trigger**: a standing, configured rule that matches events from systems kestrel does not own and
  starts work. GitHub, Slack, Linear, generic webhook, and schedule are first-party, and every one of
  them round-trips, so the surface that started a workspace receives the result there.
- **Workspace**: the durable, joinable thread of work. It owns its history and its participants,
  survives restarts, and contains many sessions over its life.
- **Session**: one execution of a harness inside one environment, with a start, an end, and an
  exit status. At most one session is active in a workspace at a time, which is what makes turn-taking a
  correctness property.
- **Environment**: the isolated compute a session executes in. Disposable, provisioned by a pluggable
  compute backend, and destroyed when the session finishes.
- **Workflow**: a standing declaration of a roster of agents that may be enqueued, and the caps and
  failure tolerances that bound one enactment of it. The sequence is not declared: a session grows it at
  runtime by enqueueing further workspaces, and nothing outside the roster may be enqueued. One
  enactment is a campaign, which owns the workspaces enqueued under it, the concurrency and spend caps
  binding them, and the scope a cancellation applies to.

Participants in a workspace are humans or agents, and the workspace makes no structural distinction
between them: a person joining a running workspace and an agent taking a turn are the same kind of
thing happening to the same record. That symmetry is deliberate, and it is what lets a session hand the
turn to a human without the workspace having to become a different object. Handing work to another
*agent* is a different act: it enqueues a new workspace rather than taking a turn in this one.

## Who it is for

Platform engineering teams at mid-size organizations are the north star. That is where the gains
compound, because one person's setup becomes everyone's throughput and the governance question is a
live one. Solo developers and small teams are the on-ramp, and the way kestrel gets built in the
first place, so the single-machine docker-compose path is a first class experience and not a demo
mode.

There are two people to serve here and they want different things: boring to operate, delightful to
use. Whoever installs kestrel and whoever works in it are rarely the same person, and pretending
otherwise gives you a product that demos well and cannot be run, or one that runs beautifully and
has no users. When the two conflict, the developer surface wins.

The bar for that surface is set by exemplars rather than adjectives: opencode's TUI, Linear,
Tailscale, Stripe. The common thread is products that have put real thought into how people use them
and try to be seamless, and the review question when something is in doubt is whether those teams
would have shipped it.

Flexibility and "it just works" resolve into one rule: opinionated defaults, swappable underneath.
One command yields a working system, with SQLite, Docker, a default model, and opencode already
chosen for you. The first PR needs no kestrel configuration. Optional integrations, managed Skills,
external MCP servers and Organization SSO need declarations or credentials when a team chooses to
use them; none is a prerequisite for the default path.

## What v1 means

v1 is a stability lock. It freezes the implementation and commits to no breaking changes until v2:
semver on the public API, migrations that never lose workspaces, a documented upgrade path, and a
deprecation policy. The day it lands is the day this project is willing to stop changing its mind,
which puts it deliberately far out; the `0.x` line carries real, recommended releases and is where
people will live for a long time.

The gate is an internal one. kestrel drives a harness by speaking the Agent Client Protocol
to it, so the seam is proven against two ACP agents of different lineages — one that speaks the
protocol natively and one reached through an adapter — because that line is where resume behaviour,
permission granularity and declared capabilities all differ, and a client with opencode-shaped
assumptions fails on it. Adoption is the right outcome but the wrong line, since it is not something
the project controls. Twelve capabilities are the content of that freeze:

1. **Trigger ingestion**: GitHub, Slack, Linear, Jira, Microsoft Teams, GitLab, generic webhook,
   and schedule can start work. The seven external surfaces round-trip: the place that started work
   receives its outcome. A schedule has no external recipient, so its result is visible in kestrel.
   Generic CloudEvents ingestion is the core and the named integrations are adapters over it, so
   another source is a contribution rather than a fork. Operators can dry-run a Trigger against a
   sample or recorded Event without opening a Workspace, and trace every evaluation, including
   nonmatches and ignored Firings. Scheduled Triggers support intervals and time-zone-aware cron
   expressions; their Events take the same recorded path as external Events. An Event
   supplies data, never authority.
2. **Scheduling**: placement, concurrency limits per organization and per campaign, a spend cap on
   every campaign, and a queue that never rejects. kestrel retries *dispatch*, never *work*: a session
   that never started is dispatched again, a session that started and failed is never re-run, and a
   workflow that wants the work retried enqueues a new session. Priority is excluded from v1 on purpose,
   since fairness cannot be tuned without production load the project does not have yet; ready order
   is FIFO, which is an order rather than a priority. The Client shows queued work, wait reasons and
   Campaign spend; an operator can pause a Campaign without terminating its active Sessions, resume it,
   or cancel it and terminate active Sessions.
3. **Isolated execution**: every session in its own environment, provisioned through a compute contract
   kestrel defines rather than a layer kestrel owns. An authorized operator can inspect live files
   and unpublished work, including committed but unpushed, uncommitted and untracked changes; a
   Policy-governed interactive Instance shell is audited rather than a raw compute-backend escape.
4. **Model choice**: any provider the configured harness supports, selectable per agent, with keys
   held per organization and reaching an environment only when a session needs them. Uniform behavior
   across models is not promised, and neither is model availability across harnesses: "any model" is
   scoped to whichever harness you are running, and to whether that harness lets a client select one
   at all. A session whose agent names a model the harness cannot honour fails rather than quietly
   running a different one. The Client shows the requested and effective model and explains a
   harness capability mismatch.
5. **Persistent workspaces**: a workspace survives everything except deliberate deletion, and an
   environment survives nothing. Process restart, environment teardown, and control-plane upgrade all
   preserve the workspace and its full transcript, and a session interrupted by a restart ends with an
   explicit exit status. Workspaces do not stay open forever: an idle one is sealed, which ends it
   without deleting it — a sealed workspace is readable and is never reopened, and work that would have
   continued it starts a new workspace that records the sealed one. Nothing expires a transcript entry
   at any age; there is no retention knob, only deletion you asked for. The Client distinguishes that
   durable Workspace from the Harness's ACP conversation continuity, and shows the branch, pull
   request or merge request, and unpublished work that can be recovered or reviewed.
6. **Pluggable storage**: SQLite for the single-machine path, Postgres for production.
7. **Multiplayer**: one uniform promise, designed to the weakest transport kestrel supports, so every
   deployment gets the same guarantees and the faster ones are only faster. People can discover,
   read, join and take turns in authorized Workspaces; Policy checks those operations separately.
   Presence is best-effort and never gates correctness, and sharing a link grants no authority.
8. **Workflows**: a declared roster rather than a declared sequence, with the sequence grown at
   runtime by sessions enqueueing further workspaces against it, under a campaign's caps and failure
   tolerances. A handoff is an enqueue and never a message: kestrel delivers ordering and once-only
   dispatch, there is no coordination bus, and the brief passes as the new workspace's first transcript
   entry, which makes a handoff auditable and joinable by construction rather than private. Work runs
   concurrently *across* workspaces while at most one session is ever active *within* one — Temporal, Step
   Functions, Prefect and Restate all draw that line the other way, which is why it is worth stating
   rather than assuming. The Client shows a navigable Campaign graph with child Workspaces,
   dependencies, status, blocked reasons and spend; authorized people can follow up, pause, resume
   and cancel.
9. **Governance**: an audit record, policy enforced at the execution layer rather than by prompt, and
   a real path for routing an approval outward to the human the policy authorizes to resolve it —
   who is usually not in the workspace, and does not join it by answering. Operators sign in through
   OIDC or SAML, with identity-provider groups mapped to Organization access grants; a local
   administrator path serves the single-machine installation. External approvers remain verified
   external principals, without mandatory kestrel accounts. Authorized operators can search and
   filter the Audit Record, inspect decision inputs and the Policy snapshot, follow links to the
   relevant work, and export stable paged records; routine output redacts secrets.
10. **Browser Client**: a high-quality place to start and follow work, inspect live transcripts,
    state, files and diffs, take a turn, and answer an Approval or Question. By v1 it handles routine
    work and administration after initial installation, with prompt feedback, accessible and
    responsive interaction. The CLI remains useful for scripting and power use.
11. **Managed Skills**: an Organization catalog holds versioned Skills selected by Projects and
    Agents. kestrel stages them at the Harness's filesystem convention; the harness chooses
    when to load one or invoke it as a command. A repository Skill of the same name wins unless
    Policy denies it, and the effective source is visible without overwriting repository files. A
    Session fails visibly if a selected Skill cannot be staged. It retains the exact managed versions
    delivered to it and records Skills the agent advertises using, without inventing a use claim
    when the agent reports none.
12. **MCP extensibility**: kestrel supplies its own MCP tools and Organization-managed external MCP
    servers selected by Projects and Agents. Stdio works across supported harnesses; HTTP is used
    when the harness advertises it, with SSE compatibility where needed. Unsupported transport
    fails visibly. kestrel mediates external tool calls under Policy, records them in the Audit
    Record, and supplies per-server, per-Session credentials without ambient secrets in the harness.
    Event data and unreviewed repository MCP configuration cannot grant tool authority.

Underneath all of it sits one pluggability rule: every pluggable layer ships at least two real
implementations at v1, one of them the default. A contract with a single implementation is an
untested abstraction, and a release whose whole purpose is to freeze interfaces cannot afford to
freeze one that has only ever been driven once.

## Where it runs

kestrel has to be portable enough to adopt wherever a team already runs things, so serverless is a v1
commitment alongside the obvious targets: docker-compose, Kubernetes, ECS, Cloud Run, Azure Container
Apps, Vercel, AWS Lambda, and Cloudflare. None of them is a way to avoid paying for a server: at
kestrel's capability floor every one of them converts to a standing monthly bill, so they buy
portability rather than a cheap tier, and the free path is docker-compose on your own machine.
Platform-specific adapters are accepted as the cost of that, because the realtime seam alone spans
five genuinely different connection models and pretending they intersect produces a contract that
lies.

The rule about configuration survives the move: zero required *kestrel* configuration, with vendor
credentials treated as the platform's cost of entry rather than as kestrel config. Every supported
target has a one-command path to a first PR with no kestrel config file, and every adapter names a
default compute pairing so that choice never lands on whoever is adopting it.

## What kestrel is not

- **kestrel does not write an agent loop**, and does not own a contract for one: it speaks the
  Agent Client Protocol as a client. opencode is the default, and Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI or
  anything else that speaks ACP can drive a session.
- **Not a hosted SaaS**: there is no plan to run one, and the data model only avoids foreclosing it,
  which is why `Organization` is carried by every durable record from the first migration.
- **Not a CI/CD replacement**: kestrel schedules agent work in response to events and leaves your
  pipelines where they are.
- **Not an IDE or a laptop-attached agent**: it has to be runnable on your own machine, via
  docker-compose or Kubernetes, and that is a separate thing from attaching to your editor.

## Prior art

kestrel is not the first thing in this shape and does not claim to be. Open-Inspect is MIT licensed,
built on opencode, ships multiplayer and multi-source triggers, and is worth reading before you read
anything here; its control plane is bound to Cloudflare Durable Objects, which hand it a per-workspace
single-threaded actor, colocated SQLite, hibernatable WebSockets, and a per-object alarm, and those
happen to be exactly the four hard parts of durable multiplayer. OpenHands covers much of the same
ground, with governance apparently behind an enterprise tier.

Where a capability is already covered, kestrel's answer is to do it better rather than to cede it or
go hunting for an unoccupied corner. In practice that means a control plane that runs on
infrastructure you choose, cooperative multi-tenancy with a per-organization audit record, and
governance in the open core. Ramp reports that its own Inspect writes more than half of its merged
PRs, and that is the number to beat rather than a reason to pick a smaller problem.

## The project

kestrel is Apache-2.0, in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). It clears enterprise review as cleanly as MIT while
adding a patent grant and a trademark clause, and it is a license this project would still accept if
commercial pressure arrives, which is the test that matters given how expensive relicensing is later.

kestrel will not be relicensed. Contributions come in under the
[Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/), signed off with
`git commit -s`, and there is no CLA: a CLA's substantive function is relicensing optionality, which
this project is declining on purpose. The DCO already binds it mechanically, so saying it out loud
costs nothing and turns a technicality into a promise you can read.

Governance is BDFL for now: one maintainer, Jack Moore, with a written path to adding more as
contributors show up. There is no `GOVERNANCE.md`, because a paragraph is the right size for a
project at this stage, and inventing a steering committee for a repo with one contributor would be
worse than saying nothing.
