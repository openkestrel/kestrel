# `kestrel`

The control plane: one image, every role selected by argv
([ADR-0002](../../docs/adr/0002-two-deployables-the-environment-dials-out.md)). With no command it
starts every role in one process, which at `0.1` is the only supported topology.

It carries the `kestrel-control-plane` binary, the built browser Client under
`/usr/share/kestrel/client` (named by `KESTREL_CLIENT_DIR`, and served on the operator listener),
a `docker` client, and `curl` for a healthcheck to
ask the operator boundary with. It does not carry the `kestrel` Client: an operator installs that
where they are, and it reaches the control plane over the operator boundary rather than from
inside this container ([ADR-0015](../../docs/adr/0015-the-cli-is-a-client-not-a-role.md)). The client is not a convenience: the default
`Compute` driver provisions an Environment by executing `docker`, so the work role in a container
is only as real as the client beside it
([ADR-0008](../../docs/adr/0008-the-control-plane-ships-dynamically-linked.md), which also records
why the binary is dynamically linked rather than a static musl build on `scratch`).

## Building it

The build context is the repository root, because the binary is built from source in it:

```sh
docker build --file images/kestrel/Dockerfile --tag kestrel .
```

Both base images are pinned by digest, the Rust toolchain by `rust-toolchain.toml`, and the crates
by `Cargo.lock` under `--locked`. The exception is apt, which resolves `ca-certificates` and
`docker-cli` to whatever the Debian release carries on the day — the one thing here that moves
without the Dockerfile changing.

CI writes the image's size and build time into the summary of the run that builds it, and publishes
`ghcr.io/openkestrel/kestrel` from a clean checkout: `latest` and the built commit when the image's
inputs change on `main`, and its version on a release tag.

## Running one by hand

```sh
docker run --rm \
  --volume kestrel:/var/lib/kestrel \
  --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  --user root \
  --publish 7717:7717 \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:7718:7718 \
  --env KESTREL_LINK=http://host.docker.internal:7717 \
  ghcr.io/openkestrel/kestrel
kestrel status
```

**The database is on the volume, and nothing else is.** `KESTREL_DATA_DIR` is `/var/lib/kestrel`,
kestrel creates and migrates its database there on first start, and replacing the container over
the same volume is the upgrade. A volume Docker initialises from the image comes up owned by the
unprivileged `kestrel` user; a host directory bind-mounted over that path does not, and has to be
made writable by that user first.

**`KESTREL_LINK` is not optional in a container.** The control plane tells an Environment where to
dial by handing it the address it bound, which inside a container is an address that reaches
nothing. Give it the name the Environment resolves the control plane by.

**The link listens on every interface here**, because what dials it is an Environment outside this
container ([ADR-0002](../../docs/adr/0002-two-deployables-the-environment-dials-out.md)). The
binary's own default is loopback, which is the right default for a binary on a laptop and the wrong
one in an image.

**So does the operator boundary, and it authenticates nobody.** A Client outside the container is
the only thing that reaches it, so it listens on every interface the container has, and the control
plane warns that it does. Publish it on the host's loopback, as above, and on nothing else. Every
network the container joins can reach it too, and that includes the one an Environment dials the
link on.

**Reaching the daemon by its socket costs the unprivileged user.** The image runs as `kestrel`, and
a bind-mounted `/var/run/docker.sock` is root's, so a by-hand run either joins that group or is
root — which is what `--user root` above is buying, and why it is not what a deployment should do.
A daemon reachable over TCP, named by `DOCKER_HOST`, needs neither — which is what
[`compose.yaml`](../../compose.yaml) does, through a proxy that forwards the requests the driver
makes and refuses the rest
([ADR-0009](../../docs/adr/0009-the-daemon-is-reached-through-a-filtered-proxy.md)).

## Roles

```sh
docker run --rm … ghcr.io/openkestrel/kestrel serve  # the operator boundary, the link and the webhooks
docker run --rm … ghcr.io/openkestrel/kestrel work   # claim queued Sessions and execute them
```

Those are the only two. Anything an operator asks for goes through the `kestrel` Client to `serve`,
never through a command run against the database in process.

Splitting the roles across processes needs an out-of-process `Fanout` and `Timer`, which rung one
does not have; the argv seam exists so that the deployment shapes that split them later need no
second artifact.
