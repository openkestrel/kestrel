# `kestrel-dev`

The image Kestrel's own development runs in. It derives from [`kestrel-env`](../kestrel-env/README.md)
and keeps its supervisor entrypoint, user, and working directory. It adds what an agent needs to
work on this repository without setting anything up in its checkout:

| Tool | Pinned by |
| --- | --- |
| Rust 1.96.0 with `cargo`, `rustfmt`, and `clippy` | the `rust` base image digest, matching `rust-toolchain.toml` |
| `gcc` and `libc6-dev`, which link the workspace and compile its C dependencies | Debian's release on the day of the build |
| `git` | inherited from `kestrel-env` |
| `gh` | `GH_VERSION` and a SHA-256 per architecture |
| OpenCode 2 (`opencode acp`) | inherited from `kestrel-env` |
| Claude Code (`claude-agent-acp`) and Codex (`codex-acp`) | `package-lock.json`, installed with `npm ci` |

The two Node adapters bring the `node` binary with them, which the base image deliberately leaves
out ([ADR-0007](../../docs/adr/0007-acp-is-the-agent-runtime-contract.md)).

## Building it

Build `kestrel-env` first. Both builds use the repository root as the context:

```sh
docker build --file images/kestrel-env/Dockerfile --tag kestrel-env .
docker build --file images/kestrel-dev/Dockerfile --tag kestrel-dev .
```

`--build-arg KESTREL_ENV=<image>` derives it from a different base tag. The tests use it to derive
from the `kestrel-env` image the run is consuming: what CI built for the change, or the
`kestrel-env:test-<checkout>` the tests built themselves when nothing named one, tagged per
checkout so two checkouts on one daemon never build over each other's.

To bump an adapter, change its exact version in `package.json`, then regenerate the lockfile in the
same Node image the build uses so the Linux optional dependencies are recorded:

```sh
docker run --rm --volume "$PWD/images/kestrel-dev:/w" --workdir /w \
  node@sha256:50c3b2f6988dfc307b86e5301d69611af31f4789bdf232863b07d3b02fe55ae0 \
  npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts
```

To bump `gh`, change `GH_VERSION` along with both digests:

```sh
curl --location --silent "https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/download/v<version>/gh_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz" | sha256sum
```

## Running Kestrel's Sessions in it

Point the control plane's `KESTREL_IMAGE` at it, for example with a gitignored
`compose.override.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  kestrel:
    environment:
      KESTREL_IMAGE: kestrel-dev
```

Do not do this with `KESTREL_ENV_IMAGE`. Compose builds the `kestrel-env` Dockerfile under that
tag, so the base image would overwrite this one.

An Agent names its harness as `opencode`, `claude` or `codex`, and the work role spawns
`opencode acp --print-logs`, `claude-agent-acp` or `codex-acp` for it.

## No credentials

Nothing in the image signs a harness or `gh` in. The home directory contains only the skeleton
files `useradd` creates, and no variable in the image's environment names a key, token, or secret.
Credentials come in when the Session starts ([ADR-0010](../../docs/adr/0010-a-provider-credential-crosses-the-link-at-the-spawn.md)).
A Subscription Profile's files, such as `.codex/auth.json`, are written beneath `/home/kestrel`
for the length of one Session and removed when it ends
([ADR-0025](../../docs/adr/0025-subscription-profiles-are-personal.md)). An OpenCode Go or Zen
subscription is a Subscription Profile variable (`OPENCODE_API_KEY`) rather than a file, and an
opencode `auth.json` is a one-time seed into the harness's database, not a login kestrel refreshes
([ADR-0026](../../docs/adr/0026-kestrel-carries-named-credentials-never-a-runtimes-store.md)). `gh`
reads `GH_TOKEN` from its own environment. The token's scope is the operator's and kestrel does not
narrow it: a `repo`-scoped token merges pull requests as well as opening them, so a human merge gate
needs a reviewer identity other than the token's ([GitHub automation](../../docs/usage/github-automation.md#give-the-agent-github-tools) covers it where the
credential is set).

## How it is checked

`crates/kestrel/tests/development.rs` holds ignored tests. CI runs them on every change: the
toolchain, `git`, and `gh` each run; each of the three harnesses answers an ACP `initialize`; and no
credentials are present. `kestrel_passes_its_own_checks_in_the_image` mounts the checkout read-only
and runs the same `fmt`, `clippy`, `build`, and `test` commands as CI's workspace job. Because it
compiles the workspace three times, it runs in the scheduled `Development image` workflow:

```sh
cargo test --locked --package kestrel --test development -- --ignored kestrel_passes_its_own_checks
```

`crates/kestrel/tests/subscription.rs` holds the one check CI cannot run: a real model call through
each harness on a person's own subscription, repeated after the control plane and the Instance are
replaced. It needs that person's login, so it runs only by hand; [Subscription profiles](../../docs/usage/subscription-profiles.md#use-and-check-the-profile) explains how.
